Given an array of objects:

```
class Company
    attr_accessor :name, :size

    def initialize(name, size)
        @name = name
        @size = size
    end
end

companies = [
    Company.new('Alpha', 30),
    Company.new('Beta, 300),
    Company.new('Delta, 3000)
]
```

Use the `app.rb` file to:

* Generate a list of strings with the name and size (eg. "Alpha - 30")
* Combine all the sizes with reduce
* Filter the list to show only companies over 100
* Find the company named "Beta"
* Find the largest company
* Sort the companies from largest to smallest
